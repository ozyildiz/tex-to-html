# What about

Imagine a pdf file that contains some essential information and some auxiliary
notes. It would be great to be able to stare at the essential information
without having to scroll through endless notes. Being able to fold and unfold
said notes would be great, but pdf doesn't handle that! (Does it?) HTML and CSS
could be used to achieve the intended result.

I don't want to manually convert the tex file that outputs my pdf into an HTML
file. I would like a script to do it. And here is my attempt at writing one.
