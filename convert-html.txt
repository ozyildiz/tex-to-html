This document contains notes on generating an html version of the MECORE
questionnaire based on whatever .tex file we write on Overleaf. That html
version could contain folds, etc., that improve the legibility or useability of
the document.

Clone the Overleaf files
git clone https://git.overleaf.com/61e1c8973b0cbd4c2036bea9 

Strip TeX commands etc. from the tex file
detex file.tex > output.txt

This would definitely work, but perhaps if I could write my own script, I could
directly get things like section titles into <h> tags etc.
