A tex file has:
a preamble,
a body,
commands with arguments,
commands without arguments,
environments.

From the preamble, we want to extract title and author information. Then, we can simply delete anything up to "\begin{document}" included and "\end{document}" at the end.

We will want a function that extracts things in curly brackets, but we'll also want to translate things like \textbf into <b>...</b>

Problems:
	- \ref and \label
